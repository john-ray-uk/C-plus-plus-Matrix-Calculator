# **C++ Matrix Calculator (MatCalc)**

This is my code for a C++ program that takes numerical inputs, turns them into a matrix format, and then lets the user perform simple operations on the matrices (addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and "division" or multiplying by a matrix's inverse, if applicable). It took me a solid day or two to code, having spent a good couple of days prior learning C++ from an online tutorial on 
[W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp). It's bound to be flawed here and there, but I think it still functions well as a first C++ project.

It's also embedded on my website here: https://johnray.co.uk/projects/MatCalc/ using a C++ compiler and embed from JDoodle.com. The website version requires "Interactive Mode" to be enabled on the <iframe> block, 
or alternatively you can preemptively type inputs into the program using the STDIN box provided.
